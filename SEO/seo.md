# Search Engine Optimization -- What is it?



# Factors
  @Main: SEO is about making sure your website has great content.

  1. Words matter
    When someone searches certain words, SE's only pull up websites related to those search words.
      e.g., if I search "computers", the SE will only display websites about computers.

  2. Titles matter
    Each webpage has an official title. SE's pay a lot of attention to titles. So include a good, accurate title in your title html in your head.
      <head>
        <title>Advanced Computer Repair</title>
      </head>

    h1, h2, ... etc also matter, as SE's look at these for description about the website
      <h1>Computer Basics</h1>

  3. Links between webpages
    Links are the most important external signal for search ranking.
    Links are essentially votes.
    When one webpage links to a second webpage, it's usually a recommendation, tell readers 'this site has good information.'
    If a website has many other websites pointing at it, this looks really good.
    However, SE's give more weight to links that are considered to be of better quality.
      @Larger: A link from any large, respectable site is going to be higher on the quality scale than a link you get from commenting on a blog.
      @Related: Links from related sites (sites that are topically relevant to your site) *may* also count more.
      @Multiple-sources: Links from 1000 different sites count for more than 1000 links from 1000 sites.

    *Bogus Webpages*
      Some people try to fool SEO by buying bogus webpages that point to their own website
      Usually, SE's can detect these bogus webpages, and give links from them less weight than links from legit webpages.


  4. Words in Links (Anchor Text)
    If you link to `www.Newegg.com` and include the word `computers`, the SE will now recognize newegg as being connected to `computers`. So when you search `computers`, newegg will rank better.


  5. Reputation
    Sites with a consistent record of fresh, engaging content, and growing numbers of quality links are viewed as rising stars, and fair better in search rankings.

  6. Engagement
    How engaging is your site?
      @Pogosticking -- Do users stay on your page for a while and click through your pages, or immediately bounce back to the search result to try something else? SE's check `time on site`

  7. Softs
      @Likes, @Shares, @Comments, @Tweets, @etc -- likely these don't bump your SE ranking up directly; however, a strong social presence has some obvious and less-obvious benefits:
        The Obvious:
          @Social-presence -- Sure, if you're a restaurant, posting sales and food pics will get you at least a few likes. However, these are largely seen as advertisements and passed over by several viewers. Rather, aim to have a real, authentic social-presence. Treat social media as a platform where you interact with customers in a light-hearted but genuine way. They are bombarded by enough advertisements as is, so spare them that. Rather than advertising the day, you're advertising your brand.

          Participating on relevant social media platforms in a real, authentic way:
            1) increases the number of clicks to your site, and
            2) increases the amount other people reference you (and your site).

          Alternatively, you advertising yourself in a creative way may also generate clicks. Take Denny's for example:
            http://imgur.com/gallery/jKs0n
            https://www.buzzfeed.com/patrickcampbell/pancakes-and-krill?utm_term=.lneW8kZpa#.pfZ9ZVG7e

        The Less-Obvious
          @Brand-Loyalty -- This is on the users' end. If they 'liked', 'shared', 'tweeted', or previously searched your site, it gets higher up on `their` ranking. If they visited your site before, it ranks higher for them.

  8. Violations
    @Thin-content: As of Feb 2011, Google penalizes websites with thin or shallow content and essentially treats them as spam. The purpose is to promote websites with content that is useful and valuable to the user.

    @Cloaking: Sophisticated Hiding. These sites are designed to show the SE a different site than the user. These can lead to your site being banned.

    @Keyword-stuffing: SE rank you by the words you use on your page. However, by repeating the same word 100 times in a row, you set yourself up for Google's scorn.

    @Hidden-text: This includes putting white text on a white background, setting the p to display:none, etc. If the SE can see it, the user should also be able to see it.

    @Ads: You won't usually be penalized for ads, but if you have so many ads that are placed before the content such that they frustrate the user experience, you may be subject to penalty.

    @Link-spamming: Don't use automated software to spam your website link on a bunch of forums and blogs. This doesn't work and may get your site penalized.
