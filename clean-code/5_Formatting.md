1. Vertical Openness Between Concepts
  - Each group of lines represents a complete thought. These thoughts should be separated from each other with blank lines.

2. Vertical Density
  - Lines that are closely associated should be densely packed. Comments inserted between these lines disrupt that density.

3. Vertical Distance
  - Concepts that are closely related should be kept vertically close to each other.

4. Variable Declaration
  - Variables should be declared as close to their usage as possible.
  - Local variables should appear at the top of each function.
  - In rare cases, a variable might be declared at the top of a block or just before a loop in a long-ish function.

5. Instance variables
  - Instance variables should always be declared at the top of the class.

6. Dependent Functions
  - If one function calls another, they should be vertically close, and the caller should be above the callee.
