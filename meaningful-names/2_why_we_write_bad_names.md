# Noise
  Noise is created through a variety of reason. Most common, I think is from trying to get a concept down before you forget it. Coming up with creative, informative names can distract from working through complicated concepts.

  Coming up with creative, informative names also may seem

  Noise also often occurs from being unable to think up a unique and meaningful name, or from laziness.

# Concise
  Creating meaningful names ends up making your code appear larger. Information is verbose.

  ```
    let a = 85
    let b = "This is acute"

    if (a < 90)
      return b
    end
  ```

  ```
    const ACUTE_ANGLE_MESSAGE = "This is acute"
    let vertex = 85

    isAcuteAngle(angle)
      return angle < 90
    end

    if (isAcuteAngle(vertex))
      return ACUTE_ANGLE_MESSAGE
    end
  ```
